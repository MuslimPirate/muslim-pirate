#1  :   since we'll use ES6
        then [babel] will transpile ES6 down to ES5
        the browsers only knows ES5

#2  :   there's ES6 features that [babel] can't transpile
        features like: array.form, map, promise, ...
        so using [babel-polyfill] will solve this issue
        [babel-polyfill] is heavy (50 KB)
        but you can pull the polyfills you need instead.

#3  :   [webpack] is a tool that will help us to compile
        JavaScript into a single minified file that works
        in the browser.

#4  :   [ESlint] will alert us when we make mistakes in code

#5  :   var x = createClass(
            {
                render : function(){
                    <tag></tag>
                }
            }
        );
